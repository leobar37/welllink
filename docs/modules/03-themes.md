# Module 03 — Themes & Personalization

## Overview
From PRD section 2.3, this post-MVP module focuses on visual customization of the public profile to strengthen brand alignment for advisors.

## MVP Scope
- Single default theme shared by all users with responsive behavior.
- Internal foundation for future theme switching (design tokens, CSS variables).

## Future Enhancements
- 5–10 curated presets selectable from the dashboard with live preview.
- User-defined colors and typography (v2+).
- Theme marketplace or seasonal drops.

## Dependencies
- Shares profile data with Module 02 for rendering.
- Requires dashboard controls (Module 06) to expose theme selection UI when ready.

## Metrics & Notes
- Adoption rate of non-default themes once available.
- Preview interactions vs applied themes.
- Feedback loop from advisors to prioritize presets.
